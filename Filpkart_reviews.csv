Worth the money,Sharing this review after 24 hrs of usage. The phone is a solid performer and is extremely handy.The battery is decent may be requires optimization considering 5000 mah it's not that great. Its a full day package.The display is awesome and the camera is average I'm not a big camera person so works for me.The performance of the device is satisfactory gets warm if u play bgmi but manageable.Overall happy with the purchase this is a decent phone for casual users.READ MORE,4

Brilliant,"I am a user of Moto since last 15 years and this time I am most satisfied after Moto X4 coz of the style and smooth functioning of the device. Believe me friends, almost everyone in my circle has praised this phone. Before buying the phone I was a bit worried about camera quality but it is not at all bad (see the attachments). So, no worries about it. Yes, battery drains faster but thanks to the 68W charger which charges the device in a blink of an eye. Overall, I give 8/10 stars.READ MORE",5

Over-hyped phone with pathetic camera and fake reviews,Reviewing after using more than one week. Moto has paid to almost all the influencers for a good review and create a hype about this phone and flash-sale on Flipkart is also another ploy to create unnecessary craze. This my honest review...1. The phone is not at all for the gamers. Never buy this gaming. For gaming I'll give 1/52. The phone is not for photo-lovers as both the front and rear camera are horribly bad. Never ever buy if you like to click photos. You will repent after buying... ...READ MORE,3

Value-for-money,The phone is good for moderate users. I'm quite unsatisfied with its camera and battery. The camera makes the photo quite over saturated.

Very Good,"This is My third Moto mobile ( one Power - G60 - Edge 40 Neo )Good things: For the first time I loved unboxing it smelled great . The peach fuzz edition looked great ( similar to rose gold). The weight is less Bad:Flipkart charges for open box delivery but I received and opened it myself.Compared to Moto G60 , Edge 40 Neo seems to be small and the width is squeezed ( maybe because of the curved edge display).The mobile network coverage is bad even thoe it is 5G .. my Moto G60 better....READ MORE",4

Very Good,"I recently got the Motorola Edge 40 Neo, and I must say, it's a fantastic budget option under 25k! The curved display and premium design give it a sleek look, and performance-wise, it's quite impressive. The 120Hz refresh rate adds to the smoothness, although I wish the battery life could keep up better with it. The only downsides I've noticed so far are the fast battery drain and occasional heating issues, but overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.READ MORE",4
