Web Scraping Flipkart Reviews Documentation
Overview
This project is designed to scrape product reviews from Flipkart using Python and popular libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas. The goal is to extract information such as the title, rating, and reviews of a specific product from multiple pages and store the data in a CSV file.

Code Structure
1. Importing Libraries
python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
This section imports the necessary libraries for making HTTP requests (requests), parsing HTML (BeautifulSoup), and handling data in a tabular format (pandas).

2. Initializing Variables
python
Copy code
data_list = []
An empty list named data_list is initialized to store dictionaries containing information extracted from each review.

3. Function Definition - get_page()
python
Copy code
def get_page():
    # ... (see below)
This function is responsible for scraping reviews from multiple pages. It iterates through the specified number of pages, extracts relevant information from each review, and appends the data to data_list.

4. Scraping Loop
python
Copy code
for page in range(1, number_of_pages + 1):
    # ... (see below)
A loop iterates through each page, making an HTTP request to the Flipkart page, parsing the HTML content, and extracting review information.

5. Review Extraction
python
Copy code
title = element.find('p', {'class': '_2-N8zT'}).text.strip()
rating_element = element.find('div', {'class': ''})
rating = rating_element.text.strip() if rating_element else 'N/A'
reviews_element = element.find('div', class_=lambda x: x and '_3LWZlK' in x and '_1BLPMq' in x)
reviews = reviews_element.text.strip() if reviews_element else 'N/A'
Review details such as title, rating, and reviews are extracted from each review container.

6. Dictionary Creation
python
Copy code
data = {
    'Title': title,
    'Rating': rating,
    'Reviews': reviews
}
A dictionary (data) is created for each review, containing relevant information.

7. Data List Update
python
Copy code
data_list.append(data)
The dictionary is appended to data_list.

8. Calling the Function
python
Copy code
get_page()
The get_page() function is called to start the scraping process.

9. DataFrame Creation
python
Copy code
df = pd.DataFrame(data_list)
The collected data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis or export.

10. Saving to CSV
python
Copy code
df.to_csv(r"C:\Users\Amit\Desktop/Filpkart_reviews.csv" , index=False)
The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file, and the file path can be adjusted based on the desired location.
